            <br>
            <br>
            <br>And if we should die tonight
            <br>Then we should all die together
            <br>Raise a glass of wine for the last time
            <br>
            <br>Calling out father oh
            <br>Prepare as we will
            <br>Watch the flames burn auburn on
            <br>The mountain side
            <br>Desolation comes upon the sky
            <br>
            <br>Now I see fire
            <br>Inside the mountain
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Burning the trees
            <br>And I see fire
            <br>Hollowing souls
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Blood in the breeze
            <br>And I hope that you remember me
            <br>
            <br>Oh, should my people fall
            <br>Then surely I'll do the same
            <br>Confined in mountain halls
            <br>We got too close to the flame
            <br>
            <br>Calling out father oh
            <br>Hold fast and we will
            <br>Watch the flames burn auburn on
            <br>The mountain side
            <br>Desolation comes upon the sky
            <br>
            <br>Now I see fire
            <br>Inside the mountain
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Burning the trees
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Hollowing souls
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Blood in the breeze
            <br>And I hope that you remember me
            <br>
            <br>And if the night is burning
            <br>I will cover my eyes
            <br>For if the dark returns
            <br>Then my brothers will die
            <br>And as the sky is falling down
            <br>It crashed into this lonely town
            <br>And with that shadow upon the ground
            <br>I hear my people screaming out
            <br>
            <br>Now I see fire
            <br>Inside the mountains
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Burning the trees
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Hollowing souls
            <br>I see fire
            <br>Blood in the breeze
            <br>
            <br>I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire)
            <br>And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)
            <br>And I see fire (uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)
            <br>and I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side</p>
